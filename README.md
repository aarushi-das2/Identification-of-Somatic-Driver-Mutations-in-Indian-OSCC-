# Identification of Somatic Driver Mutations in Indian OSCC 
A ML framework to prioritize somatic driver mutations in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC), with a focus on the Indian population. An XGBoost classifier is trained using genomic features derived from mutation annotation format (MAF) files, including mutation type, recurrence, runs of homozygosity (ROH), and mutational signature markers.

## Requirements
Requirements: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib xgboost

## Reproducibility
Random seeds are fixed to ensure reproducible model behavior.
